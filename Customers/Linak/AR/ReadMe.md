Linak high-level estimate for AR solution for event.

Event
They have a poster on which they want to augment 2D or 3D elements onto when a guest points the device to the poster.

Developer access
Do we still have the required keys to develop apps for iPads? (Soren/Nikolaj)
- Could Linak provide the required keys?
- Could we do it using WebXR if it is simple enough
- Could we do it as a PWA

Hardware requirements
- Ipad or Android tablet
