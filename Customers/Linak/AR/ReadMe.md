Linak high-level estimate for AR solution for event.

Event
They have a poster on which they want to augment 2D or 3D elements onto when a guest points the device to the poster.

Developer access
We have a developer account at Apple, but are unable to deploy enterprise apps. The clients need to create the certificates we need to complete this step. 
- Linak to provide certificates (how?)
- Cadpeople to understand and document the flow of the creation process

WebXR
- We discussed using WebXR but this only works on Android devices, as Apple insists on using a build-in function which we have little control over.
- PWA could be used, but have same limitations as WebXR.
- If run on Android, Playcanvas could be an option

Hardware requirements
- Ipad pro tablet

Estimates
1-2 days for apple setup
2-3 days for development of simple AR solution
