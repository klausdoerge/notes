WAP
We would like to  add a firewall for our solutions to protect some files from being accessed from public endpoints unless a user has signed in using SSO.
Can we use WAP, can we create a common WAP for all clients or is this done pr. solution/subscription?

SQL Audit
We want audit  enabled on our SQL databases, but not for every single task as this generates endless amount of data. Can we configure it to only contain sign-in/out of the databases and Umbraco?
