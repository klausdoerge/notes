WAF
We would like to  add a firewall for our solutions to protect some files from being accessed from public endpoints unless a user has signed in using SSO.
Can we use WAF, can we create a common WAF for all clients or is this done pr. solution/subscription?

SQL Audit
We want audit enabled on our SQL databases, but not for every single task as this generates endless amount of data. Can we configure it to only contain sign-in/out of the databases and Umbraco? We have multiple SQL instances we want to create audit-logs for.
